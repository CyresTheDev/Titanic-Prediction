# Titanic-Prediction

## according to kaggle ***"This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works."***
you know kaggle titanic competition right! in this project i want to solve it with multiple ways, such as knn, SVM and Logistic Regression

## fisrt algorithm is logistic regression.
**kaggle titanic competition is a classification problem and one the simplest and maybe best solutions is uning logistic regression**

our features:
1. PassengerId	
2. Survived
3. Pclass
4. Name
5. Sex
6. Age
7. SibSp	
8. Parch
9. Ticket
10. Fare
11. Cabin
12. Embarked

**my main way for cleaning this data is in Logistic-Regression.ipynb.**

and in other files i just use my final data frame to make progress faster

***the best result i got in kaggle competition was with a svm model***
